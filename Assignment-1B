Assignment 1B

1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

Channels - A subset of the image pixels which correspond to the same kind of information
Ex - red component, vertical edges, horizontal edges, all circles

Kernels - Feature extractors or operators which perform certain operation to extract information corresponding to a channel



2. Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?

Increase in kernel size results is a non-linear increase in complexity
Ex: 5x5 kernel -> 25 multiplications and 25 additions -> receptive field = 5
2 layers of 3x3 kernels -> 2 * (9 mult and 9 add) = 18 mult and 18 add -> global receptive field = 5
For this reason most the GPUs are extremely optimized to run 3x3 kernels. As GPUs have highly accelerated 3x3 convolution operation, leveraging the 3x3 acceleration fastens the computation giving us room to add more layers



3. How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)

199x199 -> 197x197 -> 195x195 -> .... -> 1x1
This is arithmetic progression with common difference -2

number of terms = (last term - first term ) / common difference
                = (1 - 199) / (-2)
                = 198/2
                = 99
