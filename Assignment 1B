Assignment 1B

1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

Channels - A collection of similar kind of information is called a channel. And all the channels put back together gives us back
the original image.
Ex - red component, vertical edges, horizontal edges, all circles

Kernels - Feature extractors or operators which perform certain operation to extract information corresponding to a channel



2. Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?

- Increase in kernel size results is a non-linear increase in number of parameters to be stored
  Ex: 5x5 kernel (receptive field 5x5) -> 25 parametes
  2 layers of 3x3 kernels (global receptive field 5x5) -> 2 * 9 parametes = 18 parameters
- GPUs are heavily optimized for 3x3 convolution operations. Using 3x3 kernel accelerates our network heavily which 
  gives us more room for adding more layers


3. How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)

199x199 -> 197x197 -> 195x195 -> .... -> 1x1
This is arithmetic progression with common difference -2

number of terms = (last term - first term ) / common difference
                = (1 - 199) / (-2)
                = 198/2
                = 99
